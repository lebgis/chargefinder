#labels Featured

= Welcome =

This little Android app finds and displays charging stations for e-cars in Germany. The lookup is based on a position and a range. The backend is based on Postgres/PostGIS and runs on http://chargefinder.tritsch.org. The backend features a HTTP/JSON interface. Right now 675 charging stations are loaded.

To take a look at the app you can watch a brief introduction on [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsJ8j0eDQUs YouTube] or you go to the Download section and download/install the apk file on your device/emulator or you checkout the source from the trunk and build the app from scratch (please follow the README in the trunk).

In any case ... have fun :).
